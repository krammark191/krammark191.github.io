                In the midst of all this excitement, the James Webb Space Telescope
                is being launched into orbit this year! Just pictures and videos of
                this thing being built are incredible in their own right, it’ll be
                exciting to see what it’s able to produce when it’s up in space. The
                James Webb Space Telescope is the biggest space telescope ever built
                and will dwarf the Hubble Space Telescope in its capabilities. This
                new behemoth of modern space technology has been in the works for
                over fifteen years. The time has finally arrived when we get to see
                the benefits of this amazing new work of technological art. This new
                creation will allow us to see even more of space in even more detail
                than we’ve ever seen it before. The manufacturing process of this
                telescope is a feat of engineering on its own. We live in an exciting
                time.
