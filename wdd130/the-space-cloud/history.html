            <h1>The First Man on the Moon</h1>
            <p>
                In 1961 President John F. Kennedy announced he wanted to put
                men on the moon. NASA worked hard to get people into space,
                and they were determined to put people on the moon. Not only
                did they need a space craft capable of getting them to the
                moon, but they also needed to get the astronauts back off the
                moon and land safely on Earth again. Apollo 11 blasted off on
                July 16, 1969. Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin and Michael
                Collins were the astronauts on Apollo 11. Four days after launch,
                the Apollo 11 crew landed on the moon in the lunar lander dubbed
                "The Eagle." Astronaut Michael Collins stayed behind in orbit
                around the moon to do experiments and take pictures while
                Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made history by being the first
                human beings to ever step foot on not only the moon, but a
                naturally formed object in space other than Earth. The two
                astronauts spent about three hours on the moon and left behind
                a United States of America flag as well as a sign. In less than
                ten years, President Kennedy's dream came true. The world made
                a monumental leap in space exploration.

            <p>
                The International Space Station was launched into low-earth orbit
                on November 23, 1998. The ISS was originally only planned to be
                used for a limited amount of time, but the lifespan of the station
                has been extended multiple times, and currently stands at 2028.
