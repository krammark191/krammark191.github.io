    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Mark. I want to build a website that shows you a different
      picture of space every time you visit it. Each picture would be of any
      medium and have information about the photographer or artist, the picture
      itself, as well as information on how to acquire the picture. This would
      be a creative way to showcase a wide variety of space-related art and
      provide the artists another platform to display their art. Would you
      like to be a part of this?
    </p>

    
    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
      My intended audience is anyone who likes pictures of space! Space is really
      cool and I want to be able to share it with anyone. Anyone who wants to look
      at various works of art will find that my website will have just what they're
      looking for. It will also have a section for those who want to purchase art.

      Content
    </h2>
    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <h4>Information</h4>
    <p>
      The Space Cloud is intended to share amazing media about universe 
      with anyone who wishes to see it. The site will start small, with 
      just basic functionality, with the core focus being a new picture, 
      video, or piece of artwork displayed every time the site is visited. 
      Having a wide variety of space media is a fun way to share images 
      and videos of our vast surroundings with those stuck in their daily 
      lives. I intend to have information about each piece of media included 
      below, where it is out of the way until it is needed, leaving the 
      screen space to the media only. There could be small questionnaires 
      on the site to gather more information, there could be artwork 
      competitions, etc. There is a lot of space out in space, and I’d 
      like to reflect that on the website. Information needed to complete 
      any of the available activities will be available on the site itself.
    </p>
    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>
      My goal is to make this website unique and fun. I would like to 
      maybe have an exploration page where it starts with an image of 
      our solar system, and you click on different planets to learn more 
      about them. It would be very cool to have loads of information and 
      sources available for anyone to discover. I love space and there is 
      so much to learn about it, and I want to be able to share as much 
      information with people as I can. Something that could be very cool 
      is to have sections for different aspects of space, such as the 
      physics part of space, especially near black holes. Other topics 
      could include constellations, space travel, planets, etc. The 
      possibilities are endless. With so much space, there are so many 
      things one can do.

    </ul>
    <h3>Hall of Fame</h3>
    <p>
      It would be neat to have a sort of hall of fame for famous pictures 
      or videos or audio recordings from space, such as the first image 
      of a black hole, the Apollo 11 moon landing recording, etc. Having 
      a page dedicated to the history of space travel and innovation, having 
      a page dedicated to the current endeavors in space exploration, and 
      having a page dedicated to the future of space flight. There has been 
      a resurgence of space exploration in the recent years, the likes of 
      which haven’t been seen since the late sixties. It’s an exciting time 
      for us, we’re at one of the most interesting times in human history. 
      There is so much happening in so many places. While we sit here there 
      are two billionaires battling it out in the space exploration industry. 
      Who knew that the future of space travel would be in the hands of two 
      billionaires locked in a modern-day space race?

    <h3>James Webb Space Telescope</h3>
    <p>
      In the midst of all this excitement, the James Webb Space Telescope 
      is being launched into orbit this year! Just pictures and videos of 
      this thing being built are incredible in their own right, it’ll be 
      exciting to see what it’s able to produce when it’s up in space. The 
      James Webb Space Telescope is the biggest space telescope ever built 
      and will dwarf the Hubble Space Telescope in its capabilities. This 
      new behemoth of modern space technology has been in the works for 
      over fifteen years. The time has finally arrived when we get to see 
      the benefits of this amazing new work of technological art. This new 
      creation will allow us to see even more of space in even more detail 
      than we’ve ever seen it before. The manufacturing process of this 
      telescope is a feat of engineering on its own. We live in an exciting 
      time.
