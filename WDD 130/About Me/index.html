    <p>Hi everyone! I'm working on a computer science degree. I want to do computer science so that I can make software and/or hardware easier for people (myself included) to use! There have been many instances where I have used software and thought "Man I wish it had this feature" or in the case of snapchat, "I wish there was an option to get rid of all this crap." I am of course talking about the discover page and whatever lies to the right of that. Also dark mode. For the love of all that's holy I want dark mode.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include playing videogames with my brother and my friends, hanging out with my friends and playing games together or going on adventures, reading books, watching movies, etc. I currently work for a company called Joes Racing Products. It's located in Everett, WA and we manufacture racing parts. I love this job and I hope that my degree will allow me to be a better asset to the company.</p>
    <p>I love the general atmosphere of BYU Idaho. Coming from a community college in Washington where any mention of religion is frowned upon, it is so nice to be among people who share my values and standards. I hope to earn my Bachelors degree here and then maybe persue a Masters at BYU Provo.</p>
    <p>I hope that in learning web design, I will be able to apply what I learn to my job, as a large part of my job includes managing product pages on our website. I have used barebones html for my job, but nothing too fancy.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for my whole life, and I love it. My favorite talk of all time is Be Ye Therefore Perfect, Eventually by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland.</p>
