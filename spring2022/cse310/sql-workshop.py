"""
CSE310 SQL Database Workshop

This simple database will store names, titles, and pay for employees.

TODO:

1) Implement display employees.  Try sorting the results.
2) Implement add new employee.  Check for invalid inputs for the pay.
3) Implement update employee pay and check if no update was made because employee name was invalid
4) Implement delete employee by implementing the get_name function.  The get_name function should list out all of the employees name with a numbered list.  The user will then select the number for the name they want to delete.
